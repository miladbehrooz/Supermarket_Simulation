# Supermarket Simulation
Simulation of the customer behavior in a supermarket with **Markov Chain Modeling** and focusing on **OOP**

The project consists of three parts:
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Calculated the **Transition Probabilities** using **data of customer movement** in a supermarket ('timestamp', 'customer_no', 'location')
- Implemented a **Markov Chain-based simulator** using **OOP** (for one or multiple customers)

### To do
- add visualization on how customers move through the supermarket
